Taking into account the advantages of all recommendation systems, they are combined into a hybrid recommendation system. Since the name and specific attributes of the hospital cannot be searched at the same time, it is divided into two searches.

Search 1: The user enters the name of a hospital to search, calculates the distance between the hospitals through a formula, and recommends the hospital with the highest similarity.

Search 2: The user selects or enters the attribute parameters of the hospital, and recommends the most similar hospital list based on these attributes.
